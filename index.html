          <p>
            My name is Anthony Nguyen and this is my portfolio page! I created
            this webpage myself while in a coding bootcamp at UTSA. I hope to
            learn more and build up on the knowledge I have of coding. In hopes
            to find a career I began to <br />self-study coding until I was able
            to apply and get accepted to UTSA's Fullstack program. My strong
            points would be Javascript while things I need to work on are HTML
            and CSS. Though I am learning I feel like I am retaining information
            really well <br />
            which will lead me to an amazing path of coding and further endulge
            my love for web-development. This site is a demonstration of my
            ability to use CSS and HTML although it isn't all that impressive, I
            do plan on improving the site as my <br />
            skills begin to develop throughout the course.
